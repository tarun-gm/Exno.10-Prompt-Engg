## üìã Procedure

| Step No. | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **1** | Open ChatGPT or a similar AI language model platform. |
| **2** | Identify the type of content to be generated (Report, Article, Case Study, etc.). |
| **3** | Apply **Query Decomposition** by breaking complex queries into smaller sub-prompts for better structure. |
| **4** | Use **Decision-Making Prompts** to allow the AI to make logical or creative content decisions. |
| **5** | Apply **Semantic Filtering** to maintain topic relevance and avoid off-topic responses. |
| **6** | Generate and compare outputs using different prompting styles. |
| **7** | Analyze how each prompting method influences clarity, structure, and coherence of content. |
